# Inbox Exercise (Jr. Dev) MentorAPM

-Client has asked to you create a new website using React.js that allows other engineers to display their available map layers.

## Directions

Create a new git branch

Create a new node js project... npm init... 

Add and use React.js as a dependency

Display a single button component that, when clicked, retrieves the data and processes it from:

[https://maps.tr.qld.gov.au/arcgis/rest/services/External/External_TRMaps/MapServer?f=pjson](https://maps.tr.qld.gov.au/arcgis/rest/services/External/External_TRMaps/MapServer?f=pjson)

Without defining icon values. Display the data similar to:

# ![Example Image](example.png?raw=true "Title")




## Notes
It is your choice on what symbols you use (font-awesome, emojis, character codes) or where you get them from, BUT they must be assigned at random, and although assigned at random, must be NOT be reused. Your goal is to display a layer hierarchy similar to [https://maps.tr.qld.gov.au/arcgis/rest/services/External/External_TRMaps/MapServer](https://maps.tr.qld.gov.au/arcgis/rest/services/External/External_TRMaps/MapServer) with the addition of symbols. 

## Completion
Submit a pull request, or merge changes, when you have completed the assignment.
